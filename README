Kanji learning tool

This project is meant to help people who learn kanji by providing examples in sentences.
After registering every correct answer and total points is also registered.
On the menu screen it is possible to choose between difficulty levels(N1,N2,N3,N4,N5) or by topics(Lebron_James,日本料理,北海度).
There is also a leaderboard with the top 3 users.
5 questions are asked then you can try again with the difficulty or topic of your choice.

I used pygame to create the UI, "kanji-lists 0.1.0" on PyPi to get a lists of the kanji in JLPT. 
I also used "Gen Jyuu Gothic Monospace Bold" as font.
Every sentences was taken from wikipedia page of the topics but some of them are from a japanese drama show called "Good Luck!!".
